For Jira integration, you must have a GitKraken pro account (accessible though a GitHub student pro account).


## Repo Branches

New branches should be made wherever a large-scale development occurs and code is unfinished. 
For example, the LiDAR and image processing pipelines have had their own branches while undergoing testing, before they are merged into master when the code is compilable.
From there, tweaks can be made either in master, or in a new branch if a pipeline overhaul occurs.
