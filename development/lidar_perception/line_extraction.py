# Notes
#   - Constant T_M_SMALL and T_B: For small slopes m < T_M_SMALL, 
#     the lineâ€™s absolute y-intercept b must not exceed a certain 
#     threshold T_B. This way, plateaus are excluded from the 
#     ground plane. 
#   - Constant T_RMSE: The root mean square error of the fit must 
#     not exceed a certain threshold T_RMSE. I'm unsure what this
#     value should be yet.
#   - Constant T_D_PREV: The distance of the first point of a line
#     to the line previously fitted must not exceed T_D_PREV, 
#     enforcing smooth transitions between pairs of successive 
#     lines. 
#   - extract_segment_lines(): Only one prototype point is expected 
#     since each bin is reduced to one point with the lowest z value.
#   - IMPORTANT: Isn't it possible for one segment to have multiple lines?
#     If so, this algorithm does not return the rho (norm) of the line,
#     nor does it indicate which bin the line starts and stops in.
#     Currently the line norm is set to the max lidar range and one line
#     is assumed per segment, starting from the origin. 
#   - Alright so I haven't techincally finsihed this. In the visualisation's
#     you can see how the length of each line is simply set as LIDAR_RANGE
#     and I'm not actually returning the real line length of rho from TLS.
#     Additionally, there can be multiple lines in each segment but I'm
#     drawing all simply from the origin rather than starting and ending in
#     the correct bins. Why am I ignoring this for now? Well, I think I can 
#     proceed for cone estimation anyways since all I need to know is what 
#     points are NOT on the ground, which I've achieved.    IMPORTANT
