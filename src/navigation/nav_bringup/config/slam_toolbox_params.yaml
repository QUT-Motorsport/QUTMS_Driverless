    #   Closer to map resolution (line 30) is better. > 1 goes crazy. 1 = odom tracking only. 
    correlation_search_space_smear_deviation: 0.05  # Amount of multimodal smearing to smooth out responses
    #   Needs to be between space_resolution/2 and space_dimension. Smaller=more responsive corrections, but more jittery

    # Correlation Parameters - Loop Closure Parameters
    #   Keep similar to correlation parameters, same reasons why
