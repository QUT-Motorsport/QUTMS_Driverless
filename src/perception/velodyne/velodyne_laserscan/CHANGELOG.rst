* Fixes pointed out by clang-tidy (`#310 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/310>`_)
  * Rearrange header includes so clang-tidy is happy.
  * Get rid of unnecessary void arguments on methods.
  * Properly mark methods as override where appropriate.

  * Fix the intensity calculation.
  * Remove the azimuth from addPoint.
  * Make sure to reset the cloud data to 0 before reusing.
  * Use underscores on pointcloud member variables.
  * Using std::lround means we don't need to add 0.5 to the result.
  * Slightly rearrange and simplify range checks.
  * Add in example launch files for VLP32C.
* Dashing fixes (`#307 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/307>`_)
  * Use std::make_unique as appropriate.

1.5.2 (2019-01-28)
------------------

1.5.1 (2018-12-10)

------------------

1.4.0 (2018-09-19)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#170 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/170>`_ from ros-drivers/maint/move_header_files
* Moving header files to traditional location inside include folders.
* Merge pull request `#160 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/160>`_ from ros-drivers/maint/updating_package_xml_to_v2
* Updated all package.xmls to ver 2. Cleaned up catkin_lint errors.
  All package.xml files are now compatible with version 2 of the
  package.xml specification in REP 140. Removed some unnecessary
  execute permissions on a few files. Fixed a missing test_depend.
* Merge pull request `#146 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/146>`_ from stsundermann/patch-2
  Use std::abs instead of fabsf
* Merge pull request `#150 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/150>`_ from ros-drivers/mikaelarguedas-patch-1
* update to use non deprecated pluginlib macro
* Use std::abs instead of fabsf
  cfg\_.resolution is double but fabsf takes a float which may cause truncation of value.
