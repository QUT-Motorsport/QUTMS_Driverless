Change history
==============

2.1.1 (2021-08-23)
------------------
* Minor fixes to string formatting. (`#396 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/velodyne/issues/396>`_)
  These changes will allow velodyne to compile without warnings
  on Rolling (soon to be Galactic).  The changes are also backwards
  compatible to Foxy if we want to backport them.
