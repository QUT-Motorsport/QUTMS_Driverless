# Notes
# 1. Constant T_M_SMALL and T_B: For small slopes m < T_M_SMALL, 
#    the lineâ€™s absolute y-intercept b must not exceed a certain 
#    threshold T_B. This way, plateaus are excluded from the 
#    ground plane. 
# 2. Constant T_RMSE: The root mean square error of the fit must 
#    not exceed a certain threshold T_RMSE. I'm unsure what this
#    value should be yet.
# 3. Constant T_D_PREV: The distance of the first point of a line
#    to the line previously fitted must not exceed T_D_PREV, 
#    enforcing smooth transitions between pairs of successive 
#    lines. 
# 4. get_ground_lines(): Only one prototype point is expected 
#    since each bin is reduced to one point with the lowest z value.
# 5. IMPORTANT: Isn't it possible for one segment to have multiple lines?
#    If so, this algorithm does not return the rho (norm) of the line,
#    nor does it indicate which bin the line starts and stops in.
#    Currently the line norm is set to the max lidar range and one line
#    is assumed per segment, starting from the origin. This has been fixed,
#    each segment CAN have multiple lines with different gradients and
#    intercepts - it's beautiful. 
# 6. i = i - 2  under new_line_points = [] can be changed to i = i - 1 
#    to increase speed of the algorithm slightly. However, there will 
#    be breaks in the ground lines which is undesired.
# 7. The original if statement after the else from if len(new_line_points) >= 2 
#    # if lines_created == 0 or len(new_line_points) != 0 or dist_point_line(new_point, lines[lines_created-2][0], lines[lines_created-2][1]) <= T_D_PREV:
#           new_line_points.append(new_point)
# 8. This was removed from the current if statement (the one that replaced the above ^ )
#       or dist_point_line(new_point, lines[lines_created-2][0], lines[lines_created-2][1]) <= T_D_PREV
