# Notes
#   - Explore Python threading for this entire process
#   - Constant M: M must be an int, the value error below it
#     checks for this (I think).
#   - get_segment(): Returns negatives but Python lists handle 
#     this and wraps around.
#   - Var segments: segments[0] is the set of all points in the 
#     first segment.
#   - get_segment(): I assume, but should check that this always 
#     returns an int
#   - Constant BIN_SIZE: Might not be a value in metres, depends 
#     on the encoding of LIDAR data. 
#   - in_bin(): Note: bins don't need to be defined by the segment 
#     they're in. They're defined by the distance from the origin.
#     Each segment will have the same number of bins spaced at the 
#     same distances away from origin. 
#     This function is currently not needed. 
#   - Constant NUM_BINS: # This NEEDS to  be an int. Perhaps I could 
#     round down or have the last bin be smaller?
#   - approximate_2D(): This 3D to 2D conversion is a propety of 
#     the bins. The greater number of bins, the more accurate the 
#     approximation. This conversion is done by getting the distance 
#     x and y are from the origin and a prime point is simply a 2 
#     dimensional vector of this norm and the z height. This function 
#     also orders the points in each bin in ascending range 
#     (distance from origin)
#   - prototype_points(): point-to-bin mapping is not one-to-one, 
#     and P_(b_j^s)^' may contain more than one point, or no points 
#     at all. A prototype point will be the point within a bin with
#     the lowest z value (height) as this point is most likely to lie
#     on the plane.
#   - T_D_GROUND: Perhaps this should be dynamic and scale with the 
#     size of bins / size of segments, rather than being static. Same
#     goes for T_D_MAX. Maybe it should be a lil dynamic too
#   - Points that constructed the ground plane lines should already be
#     labelled as ground, rather than being relablled. 
#   - num_points = len(points) # make this contanst above if its used #     a lot throughout code
#   - bruh I was about to write this exact comment ^ create a constant for 
#     the number of points and reference it instead. 
#   - I should consider sorting the points early on, I think multiple
#     parts of the program would benefit by this / already need to do this
#   - Program encounters issues if point is at EXACT xy origin, because what
#     segment is this even in? This is practically impossible to encounter however.
#   - Update len() - 1 notation to [-1] where applicable.

# 7. T_D_PREV has been updated to a dynamic mathematical relation that increases
#    as points get further from the origin. HOWEVER, T_D_PREV is used in
#    ground_plane_estimation, not here anymore. 
# 8. Implement logging
# 9. Consider removing completly empty segments at the start and see if that works!!!
#    I might still be treating this like I have a full circle of vision when really
#    It would only be 180 degrees
# 10. Investigate potential 'hacky point fix' in label_points function. I think this
#     has definitely been resolved though.
# 11. Review the non_ground_points function for the double flattening and see if 
#     this can be simpler. 
# 12. Object Reconstruction
# # You might want to sort points by x coords here
    # since that is how the clusters are sorted
    # This may reduce overall time
    # I'm gonna be hoping a point wont be in two clusters at the same time
            # therefore ill break after the first match for each point
            # Increases speed of algorithm

# Consider having the TM_SMALL simply has negative T_M, since we may have a line
# that slopes slightly downwards. But right now all angles below 0 degress are being
# filtered out

# Need to create a mathematical relationship between how many segments to check for points
# that may belong to a cluster vs. how far away the cluster is from the origin. Need to 
# consider the diameter of a cone. and mathy the bin sizs w.r.t. cone size

# bin_idx + 1 or j+1 since if a point is near the origin and in bin 0, you want it to have
# a norm from origin of at least BIN_SIZE, not 0.

# ADD AN OUTER BOUND to the desmos graph and any objects within this larger range can be 
# the 'unknown' cones that AMZ shows in their demo. Perhaps if the zed camera sees a cone 
# that matches with an unknown cone then WA-BAM NEW CONE PHASES INTO EXISTENCE
