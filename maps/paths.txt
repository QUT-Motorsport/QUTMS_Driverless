It's recommended you copy this folder to a place on your local machine and enter the file paths of any csv maps you wish to use.
This saves having to type out a whole directory path. eg:
C:\Users\QUTMS\maps\example.csv

create a new folder called 'paths.store' (so they're git ignored) and paste them in there
